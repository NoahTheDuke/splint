# Splint

**Split** is a Clojure static code analyzer and linter. It aims to warn about many of
the guidelines in the [Clojure Style Guide][style guide].

## Why?

Why another Clojure linter? We have [clj-kondo][clj-kondo], [eastwood][eastwood], and
[kibit][kibit], in addition to [clojure-lsp][clojure-lsp]'s capabilities built on top of
clj-kondo. I have contributed to most of these, and recently took over maintenance of
kibit. However, most of them aren't built to be easily modifiable, and while kibit's
rules are simple, the underlying engine (built on [core.logic][core.logic]) is quite
slow. This means that adding or updating the various linting rules can be quite
frustrating and taxing.

Inspired by [RuboCop][rubocop], I decided to try something new: A "fast enough" linting
engine based on linting code shape, built to be easily extended.

## Non-goals

For speed and simplicity, Splint doesn't run any code, it only works on the provided
code as text. As such, it doesn't understand macros or perform any macro-expansion
(unlike Eastwood) so it can only lint a given macro call, not the resulting code.

clj-kondo performs lexical analysis and can output usage and binding information, such
as unused or incorrectly defined vars. At this time, Splint makes no such efforts. It is
only focused on code shape, not code intent or meaning.
