# Splint

**Splint** is a Clojure linter focused on style and code shape. It aims to warn about many of the guidelines in the [Clojure Style Guide][style guide]. It is inspired by the Ruby linter [RuboCop][rubocop] and the Clojure linter [Kibit][kibit].

## Installation and Usage

More explicit instructions can be found in the [installation][installation], [usage][usage], and [configuration][configuration] pages, but here's a quick rundown:

[installation]: docs/installation.md
[usage]: docs/usage.md
[configuration]: docs/configuration.md

### Clojure CLI

```clojure lazytest/skip=true
:aliases {:splint {:extra-deps {io.github.noahtheduke/splint {:mvn/version "1.21.0"}}
                   :main-opts ["-m" "noahtheduke.splint"]}}
```

Run with `clojure -M:splint [args...]`.

### Leiningen

Add this to `project.clj`:

```clojure lazytest/skip=true
:profiles {:dev {:dependencies [[io.github.noahtheduke/splint "1.21.0"]]}}
:aliases {"splint" ["run" "-m" "noahtheduke.splint"]})
```

Run with `lein splint [args...]`.

### Babashka

Requires version 1.12.205 or later. If using `bb.edn`, add this to `bb.edn`:

```clojure lazytest/skip=true
:tasks {splint {:extra-deps {io.github.noahtheduke/splint {:mvn/version "1.21.0"}}
                :task noahtheduke.splint/-main}}
```

Run with `bb splint [args...]`.

## Rationale

Why another Clojure linter? We have [clj-kondo][clj-kondo], [eastwood][eastwood], and [kibit][kibit], in addition to [clojure-lsp][clojure-lsp]'s capabilities built on top of clj-kondo. I have contributed to most of these, and recently took over maintenance of kibit. However, most of them aren't built to be easily modifiable, and while kibit's rules are simple, the underlying engine (built on [core.logic][core.logic]) is quite slow. This means that adding or updating the various linting rules can be quite frustrating and taxing.

Inspired by [RuboCop][rubocop], I decided to try something new: A "fast enough" linting engine based on linting code shape, built to be easily extended.

## Non-goals

For speed and simplicity, Splint doesn't run any code, it only works on the provided code as text. As such, it doesn't understand macros or perform any macro-expansion (unlike Eastwood) so it can only lint a given macro call, not the resulting code.

clj-kondo performs lexical analysis and can output usage and binding information, such as unused or incorrectly defined vars. At this time, Splint makes no such efforts. It is only focused on code shape, not code intent or meaning.

Versions are not semantic, they are incremental. Splint is not meant to be infrastructure, so don't rely on it like infrastructure; it is a helpful development tool. It should not be relied on as a library. I make no guarantees about public API, visibility of functions, consistency of data shape, or otherwise. I hope to maintain consistent `json` and `edn` output so users can expect that to stay the same, but everything inside of Splint should be considered implementation detail.
